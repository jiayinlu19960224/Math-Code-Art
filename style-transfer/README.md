# Style Transfer

## Brief Description

This tutorial introduces students to **Neural Style Transfer (NST)**, a technique that blends the content of one image with the artistic style of another using a fixed, pre-trained **VGG19** network. Unlike traditional neural networks that update model weights, NST instead optimizes the pixels of the input image.
This unconventional setup makes NST an ideal entry point for understanding how convolutional networks represent structure and texture.

Students will explore how CNN feature maps encode visual information, how Gram matrices serve as texture fingerprints, and how adjusting content and style loss shapes the final output. The tutorial aims to build intuition for feature extraction, linear-algebraic representations, and gradient-based optimization—connecting mathematics, coding, and artistic creativity.
