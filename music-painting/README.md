# Music Painting

## Brief Description
This tutorial demonstrates how musical information can be extracted from audio pieces using the librosa library. Then, using mathematical functions, audio features are mapped through a custom rgb_mix function that translates musical data into smoothly varying RGB color values. Finally, these information are used for a random walk algorithm that generates continuous stroke paths across a canvas. Each stroke evolves in direction and position over time, and is rendered with a randomly varying brush width, which produces artistic visuals synchronized with the underlying audio. 

Students will explore how spectral features can be interpreted as control signals for visual generation, how mathematical functions shape color transitions, and how to construct random stroke and random walk algorithms.
